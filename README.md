# StackOverFlow-Sidebar
This Chrome extension enhances your Google search experience, especially for development-related queries, by automatically displaying relevant Stack Overflow questions directly on the search results page.

When you search on Google, a sleek sidebar will appear on the right-hand side. This sidebar lists up to five of the most relevant questions from Stack Overflow that match your current search query, sorted by relevance.

By using this extension, developers can streamline their information-gathering process, reduce the need to manually search Stack Overflow in a separate tab, and quickly access relevant programming knowledge directly alongside their Google search results
